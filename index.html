<h4>Quantum Club</h4>

<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to the quantum computing club! </p>

<p>To recap, our first meeting was pretty fun! We discussed why quantum computing is cool, and all of the leadership positions that you can sign up for. If you want a leadership position, please dm or email me by Friday, October 4, 2024.
Also, don't forget to research the quantum cat</p>

<p>Our second meeting was today! It was a general introduction to quantum computing, and we'll be going into everything we discussed today in more detail in upcoming meetings.
    Some key topics we talked about today include wave-particle duality, superposition, and the pros and cons of quantum computers. 
    If you missed the meeting or have any questions, feel free to reference the meeting <a herf="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWeKloA5bFmkdjcEbrQ9idWzPQcORiZU">slideshow</a> and/or ask me about anything.</p>
